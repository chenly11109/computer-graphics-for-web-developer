## Features
- **WebGPU Basics**: Learn how to initialize and use WebGPU for rendering basic 2D and 3D graphics in the browser.
- **TypeScript Integration**: Utilize TypeScript to enhance code quality and maintainability.
- **React Framework**: Use React to manage UI components and state, integrating seamlessly with WebGPU.

## Development Tools
### Vite
- A modern build tool that significantly improves the development experience by providing fast rebuilds and a dev server.
### TypeScript
- Utilize TypeScript for static type checking, enhancing developer productivity and code reliability.
- **@webgpu/types**: Provides TypeScript definitions for WebGPU. Install this package to ensure type safety when working with WebGPU APIs.
### VSCode Plugins
- **WGSL**: Install the WGSL extension for syntax highlighting and snippets for the WebGPU Shading Language.
- **3D Viewer**: Useful for viewing 3D models directly within VSCode, assisting in quick visual checks and debugging.
